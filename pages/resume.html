                <p>
                    Besides creating all the biggest tech companies in the world, I also enjoy reading <strong>Manga</strong>. The manga that is 1<sup>st</sup> in my heart is <strong>Steel Ball Run</strong>, which is the 7<sup>th</sup> part of <strong>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.</strong> The story of two men racing on horseback across America to win 50 million dollars while also trying to find the body parts of Jesus Christ before the president of the United States does will never be topped in the history of media.
                </p><br>

                <p>I also enjoy playing <strong>video games</strong>, here's a quick list of my top 3 favourite games of all time:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>1. <strong><em>Dark Souls 3</em></strong></dt>
                    <dd>A "Souls-like" game released in 2016 by FromSoftware. Very difficult, but extremely satisfying when you finally defeat a boss. I prefer it from other Dark Souls games due to better movement and controls.</dd>
                    <dt>2. <strong><em>Overwatch 2</em></strong></dt>
                    <dd>A "Hero Shooter" game released in 2022 by Blizzard Entertainment. Most fun when playing with friends, it has some of the best and most diverse cast of heroes to choose from.</dd>
                    <dt>3. <strong><em>Tekken 8</em></strong></dt>
                    <dd>A "Fighting" game released in 2024 by Bandai Namco Entertainment. I recently started playing this one and I have not been able to stop. Learning the ins and outs of my character and core fighting mechanics has been grueling (in the best way possible) </dd>
                </dl><br>

                <p>
                    Lasty, I love to watch my favourite and the best sport of all time, <strong>Hockey</strong>. My favourite team, ever since I was little, has been the <strong>Vancouver Canucks</strong> because they wore my two favourite colors at the time (blue and green), and because their two best players were Henrik and Daniel Sedin, who are twins just like me and my brother.
